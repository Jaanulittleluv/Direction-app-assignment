Challenges & Learning Outcomes
As Angular was a new framework for me, I encountered some challenges while implementing the Google Maps direction feature. Despite these challenges, I am committed to improving my expertise in Angular and refining the application's functionality.

## Installation & Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone <repository_url>
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   cd direction-app
3. Install dependencies:
   npm install
4. Run the application:
   ng serve
5. Open a browser and go to `http://localhost:4200/` to access the app.

Future Enhancements
